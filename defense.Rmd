- How do these distributions change over time, seasonally and trending with climate change? (**distributions and time**)

- What environmental covariates best predict where and when these animals are distributed? (**distributions and environment**)

- How do we effectively capture and integrate uncertainty for these distributions into decision making? (**uncertainty**)

- Once we can best describe the distribution of these species in space and time, how can we integrate this information into spatial decision frameworks? (**decision frameworks**)

    - for siting
    
    - for routing

# 2. Predicting Seasonal Migration

## Grey Whale Migration

![](./fig/gray-whale-migration_sized.png)

<div class="notes">
longest mammalian migration on planet

Eastern North Pacific gray whales make a mammoth 20,000 km (12,400 mile) round trip between their southern breeding grounds off Baja California, Mexico and their northern feeding grounds off Alaska and the Beaufort Sea. 

April - November: Arctic feeding grounds

[October - February: migrates south]

December - April: Mexican breeding grounds

[February - July: migrates north] 

In the early winter, they move south to breed in the warm, shallow lagoons along the Mexican coast. The most popular breeding lagoons are San Ignacio lagoon, Scammon's lagoon, and Magdalena Bay, on the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico. Around February, the grays migrate north to feed in Arctic waters (western Beaufort Sea and Bering Sea), northwest of Alaska. A few - mainly younger - whales make a shorter journey north from Mexico, stopping off along the coastline stretching between northern California, Oregon, Washington State, USA, and British Columbia, Canada. Some feeding behaviour has been observed in all parts of the range, and around Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, grays are present year-round.

NOTES from AquaMaps: Predictions only describe range of western population of this species, since the eastern population is probably almost extinct. Please view suitable habitat for probable former range of eastern population. Note: eastern limit of bounding box is somewhat arbitrary, but represents the minimum supported by satellite track data and acoustic detection around Cape Farewell. Species is highly migratory and distribution represents a compromise between summer and winter range. Modified SST range, since species does not occur regularly on in large numbers in Gulf of Mexico. Extended primary production envelope, since species is a filter feeder and thus likely to be directly associated with areas of high primary production. (Kristin Kaschner, 2012-04-19 11:42:28)

## Integrate Marine Mammal Distributions

- Using density spatial models for 9 marine mammal species in BC from Raincoast surveys 2004-2008

- Composite risk map derived per pixel ($i$) across $n$ species ($s$) by summing relative density ($z_i$), which is based on the pixel values' ($x_i$) deviation ($\sigma_s$) from mean density ($\mu_s$), and multiplying by conservation status ($w_s$):
  $$
  z_{i,s} = \frac{ x_{i,s} - \mu_s }{ \sigma_s } \\  
  Z_i = \frac{ \sum_{s=1}^{n} z_{i,s} w_s }{ n }
  $$

<div class="notes">
Density surface model outputs will be assembled into a marine mammal composite risk map, or cost surface. 

Each density surface was normalized in order to highlight areas of high density relative to its average.
The unitless standard score, or z-value ($z_i$), per pixel ($i$) is calculated as the pixel’s marine mammal density estimate ($x_i$) subtracted from the mean of all density estimates for the strata ($\mu$), divided by the standard deviation of those density estimates ($\sigma$) and finally multiplied by the species weight ($w_s$) according to conservation status.

Is $\sigma$ per pixel or for entire DSM?
