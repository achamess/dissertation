  abstract = {Graph theory is a body of mathematics dealing with problems of connectivity, flow, and routing in networks ranging from social groups to computer networks. Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.},

  abstract = {Abstract  There is an increasing momentum within the marine conservation community to develop representative networks of marine protected
areas (MPAs) covering up to 30\% of global marine habitats. However, marine conservation initiatives are perceived as uncoordinated
at most levels of planning and decision-making. These initiatives also face the challenge of being in conflict with ongoing
drives for sustained or increased resource extraction. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop large scale theoretical frameworks
that explicitly address conflicting objectives that are embedded in the design and development of a global MPA network. Further,
the frameworks must be able to guide the implementation of smaller scale initiatives within this global context. This research
examines the applicability of an integrated spatial decision support framework based on geographic information systems (GIS),
multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and fuzzy sets to objectively identify priority locations for future marine protection. MCE
is a well-established optimisation method used extensively in land use resource allocation and decision support, and which
has to date been underutilised in marine planning despite its potential to guide such efforts. The framework presented here
was implemented in the Pacific Canadian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) using two conflicting objectives - biodiversity conservation
and fisheries profit-maximisation. The results indicate that the GIS-based MCE framework supports the objective identification
of priority locations for future marine protection. This is achieved by integrating multi-source spatial data, facilitating
the simultaneous combination of multiple objectives, explicitly including stakeholder preferences in the decisions, and providing
visualisation capabilities to better understand how global MPA networks might be developed under conditions of uncertainty
and complexity.},

  abstract = {A primary factor threatening the recovery of the North Atlantic right whale is the ongoing risk of collision with large ocean-going vessels. Hence, any viable conservation strategy must include mitigation of this risk. In particular, the critical wintering habitat off the Atlantic shores of the southeastern United States overlaps with the shipping routes of some of the region's busiest ports. As a first step in the process of ship strike risk mitigation for this region, we estimated the risk associated with current patterns of shipping traffic, and compared this with estimates of risk for a set of hypothetical alternative routes. As a measure of risk, we selected the co-occurrence of whales and vessels within cells of a 4 km grid. We performed parametric estimation of whale encounter rate and associated risk within a Bayesian hierarchical model, using data from aerial surveys and the Mandatory Ship Reporting System of the SE United States, along with a selection of environmental covariates. Importantly, we were able to account for annual and monthly variation in encounters in our estimates. All alternative routes provided reduced overall risk, ranging from a 27 to 44\% reduction, relative to the estimated risk of observed traffic. The largest marginal gains in risk reduction were attained by restricting traffic associated with the busiest port, Jacksonville, Florida, but restrictions on all ports achieved the highest reduction. We emphasize the importance of accounting for temporal as well as spatial variation in whale encounter rates, given the migratory behavior of the species.},

  title = {Updated marine mammal distribution and abundance estimates in coastal British Columbia},
  abstract = {Information relating to the distribution and abundance of species is critical for effective conservation and management. For many species, including cetacean species of conservation concern, abundance estimates are lacking, out of date and/or highly uncertain. Systematic, line-transect marine mammal surveys were conducted in British Columbia's (BC) coastal waters over multiple years and seasons (summer 2004, 2005, 2008, and spring/autumn 2007). In total, 10,057km of transects were surveyed in an 83,547km2 study area. Abundance estimates were calculated using two different methods: Conventional Distance Sampling (CDS) and Density Surface Modelling (DSM). CDS generates a single density estimate for each stratum, whereas DSM explicitly models spatial variation and offers potential for greater precision by incorporating environmental predictors. Although DSM yields a more relevant product for the purposes of marine spatial planning, CDS has proven to be useful in cases where there are fewer observations available for seasonal and inter-annual comparison, particularly for the scarcely observed elephant seal. The summer abundance estimates (with lower and upper 95\% confidence intervals; all DSM method unless otherwise stated), assuming certain trackline detection (underestimates true population size) were: harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) 8,091 (4,885-13,401); Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) 5,303 (4,638-6,064); Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) 22,160 (16,522-29,721); humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) 1,092 (993-1,200); fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) 329 (274-395); killer whale (all ecotypes; Orcinus orca), 371 (222-621); common minke whale (B. acutorostrata) 522 (295-927); harbour seal (total in water and on the shoreline; Phoca vitulina) 24,916 (19,666-31,569); Steller sea lion (total; Eumetopias jubatus) 4,037 (1,100-14,815); and northern elephant seal (CDS method; Mirounga angustirostris) 65 (35-121). Abundance estimates are provided on a stratum-specific basis with additional estimates provided for Steller sea lions and harbour seals that were `hauled out' and `in water'. This analysis updates previous estimates (Williams and Thomas, 2007) by including additional years of effort, providing greater spatial precision with the DSM method over CDS, novel reporting for spring and autumn seasons (rather than summer alone), and providing new abundance estimates for Steller sea lion and northern elephant seal. In addition to providing a baseline of marine mammal abundance and distribution, against which future changes can be compared, this information offers the opportunity to assess the risks posed to marine mammals by existing and emerging threats, such as fisheries bycatch, ship strikes, and increased oil spill and ocean noise issues associated with increases of container ship and oil tanker traffic in British Columbia's continental shelf waters.},

  abstract = {Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing applications, siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct, the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence-function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained despite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.},

Multi-institutional efforts to reduce mortality associated with vessel strikes include vessel-routing amendments such as the International Maritime Organization voluntary ?area to be avoided? (ATBA) in the Roseway Basin right whale feeding habitat on the southwestern Scotian Shelf. Though relative probabilities of lethal vessel strikes have been estimated and published, absolute probabilities remain unknown. We used a modeling approach to determine the regional effect of the ATBA, by estimating reductions in the expected number of lethal vessel strikes. This analysis differs from others in that it explicitly includes a spatiotemporal analysis of real-time transits of vessels through a population of simulated, swimming right whales. Combining automatic identification system (AIS) vessel navigation data and an observationally based whale movement model allowed us to determine the spatial and temporal intersection of vessels and whales, from which various probability estimates of lethal vessel strikes are derived. We estimate one lethal vessel strike every 0.775?2.07 years prior to ATBA implementation, consistent with and more constrained than previous estimates of every 2?16 years. Following implementation, a lethal vessel strike is expected every 41 years. When whale abundance is held constant across years, we estimate that voluntary vessel compliance with the ATBA results in an 82\% reduction in the per capita rate of lethal strikes; very similar to a previously published estimate of 82\% reduction in the relative risk of a lethal vessel strike. The models we developed can inform decision-making and policy design, based on their ability to provide absolute, population-corrected, time-varying estimates of lethal vessel strikes, and they are easily transported to other regions and situations.},
