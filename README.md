This repository is for drafting my PhD thesis at Duke University.

Here's the draft thesis rendered in various formats:

- [docx](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xzgsxaghxkrj5e6/thesis.docx)
- [html](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jml6ybe4qa1x14k/thesis.html)

## Thesis Templates

- [UC Berkeley](https://github.com/stevenpollack/ucbthesis): uses Rmarkdown templates
- [Duke thesis](http://gradschool.duke.edu/academics/theses/): latex formatting specific to Duke

## Knitting the document

This thesis is being knitted into a scientifically reproducible document using the following techniques:

- **markdown**. [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

- **citations**. Zotero and pandoc. Use better bibtex Zotero extension to enable drag-and-drop of citation into document in Pandoc format.

See [make.R](make.R) for how these are compiled into the various forms from the Rmarkdown files.
