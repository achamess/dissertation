# Introduction

Modern conservation of marine megafauna is dependent upon prioritizing areas within the context of a changing climate and increasing array of human activities. Concurrent with a rise in conflicting human uses has been a rapid decline in overall marine biodiversity and ecosystem services [@worm_impacts_2006; @halpern_global_2008; @worm_rebuilding_2009; @butchart_global_2010]. In response, recent calls for holistic management practices, such as ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning, are encouraging multi-species, multi-sector approaches [@us_commission_on_ocean_policy_ocean_2004; @crowder_resolving_2006; @halpern_managing_2008; @crowder_essential_2008; @douvere_importance_2008; @dahl_marine_2009; @lubchenco_proposed_2010; @foley_guiding_2010]. For these applications I’ll be focusing on marine spatial planning of cetaceans, but methods will be transferable to other marine megafauna. In the US, marine mammals are legally protected through the Marine Mammal Protection Act and 22 are l/isted as threatened or endangered so are covered by The Endangered Species Act. Human activities that pose threats include: fishing bycatch or prey depletion (Laist et al. 2001), ship strikes (Weilgart 2007), anthropogenic noise (O’Shea and Brownell Jr. 1994; Aguilar et al. 2002), pollution of oil or bioaccumulating contaminants (Learmonth et al. 2006; Alter et al. 2010), and global climate change (Dolman et al. 2009). Relocating potentially harmful human activities away from known cetacean distributions is generally the safest and simplest way to minimize risk (Redfern et al. 2006).

The current state of marine spatial planning begs several broad questions of decision makers and decision support scientists. How do you optimize use of ocean resources to provide long-term ecosystem services in a sustainable manner while minimizing impacts on endangered species?  How much risk are you willing to accept?  What are the tradeoffs between conservation value and economic impact?  How do you handle poor data availability within marine systems?  How do you manage the dynamic nature of the environment with species distributions?  How do you handle uncertainty while making spatial decisions?  Which human uses require custom applications?

While much work has been done already to support description of species distributions for planning purposes (Margules and Sarkar 2007; Pressey et al. 2007; Elith and Leathwick 2009; Pressey and Bottrill 2009), there is room for improvement in answering the questions above for adopting a marine operational framework.

Over the next 5 chapters I propose methods for addressing these questions within two study areas, British Columbia and US Atlantic. 1) I start with pooling boat and plane datasets in order to incorporate more data into the species distribution models (SDMs). A variety of SDMs will be compared for their requirements, outputs and performance. Improvements in the SDMs will include novel environmental predictors, addressing scale and exploring lags in space and time. 2) Decision Mapping provides a framework for incorporating uncertainty into decision making spatially. 3) Seasonal Migrations explicitly includes time-varying habitats in SDMs. 4) Probabilistic Range Maps combine range maps and occurrence through a Bayesian environmental model. 5) In Conservation Routing layers of species data are combined into a single cost surface for routing ships using least cost paths. These tools should enable a more transparent, operational and robust set of methods for incorporating cetacean species distribution models into the marine spatial planning process.
