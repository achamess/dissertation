the other front matter tables.

Notice the change in alignment caused by the label width between this
list and the one above. Also notice that this multiline description is
properly spaced.

Abbreviations/Symbols in the item are limited to about a quarter of the
textwidth, so don’t pack too much in there. You’ll bust the margins and
it looks really bad.
