- comparable units? b/n industry vs conservation.
  - > Research How to turn into relative values
  - what is optimum from ROC perspective? Based on past precedent, say of GoM r whales.
  - relate to PBR.
- endpoints? no human use = 0?
- thresholds changing state?

- how do routes vary in different locations?

- if no hotspots in path, then no real difference. cases:
  1. little extra routing, big gain

  2. no difference

  3. major problem

- diff't tradeoffs. Lester et al (2013)

- pick time of routing.

- choose diff't areas. get shipping lanes from Marine Cadastre.

- industry profiles

- relate to magnitude of all ships, not just one off

- available as app for individual user, vs whole industry.

- compare across space (places/extents) and time! monthly maps.
  - dynamic cons risk. see route changing throughout year.

- pile driving. vs maintenance. pick a time!

- r whale at monthly. humpback daily interpolation. hold route constant, and show where shifts on curve along seasons.  
- seismic surveys for offshore oil & gas exploration. exploration, drilling, pile driving, maintenance. need big picture.

- academically, need to show tradeoffs. in space & time novel!

- Shiny server


- data from Atlantic / GoMex. JR getting manuscript out door. Politically careful. Corrie, Connie in NE.
