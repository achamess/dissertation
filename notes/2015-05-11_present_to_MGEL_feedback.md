- [Marine Cadastre](http://coast.noaa.gov/nationalviewer/):
  - AIS vessel data by type: tanker, passenger, cargo
    Q: extract to/fro paths?
  - shipping lanes
  - N Atlantic R Whale by month
  - offshore energy lease blocks: oil & gas, wind farm

- Pat, annual review to Rachel Piccolo

- [Duke Reproducible Science Workshop](http://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/2015-05-14-reproducible-science-duke/) 2015-05-14 using R/Rmarkdown/github...

- Shiny intro

- offshore energy lease blocks: oil & gas, wind farm
- timing work with uncertainty work with Brian Kinlan

- review paper w/ pseudo-absence from OBIS


- PH:
  - Crow. White et al (2012): efficiencies, optimal tradeoffs b/n industry uses, Cape Cod.
    - [updates based on curves]
  - diff't case studies
  - reword 'profit', competing use
- AB:
  - timeline? Raincoast in BC. analysis almost done.
  - another region: .
  - to get stuff working pick animal w/ good data. good contrast to compare in rich and poor data.
- JC:
  - lot of work in Atlantic to apply to this.
  - PH getting pressure w/ active planning processes. Seismic survey off NC and SC soon. [good ]
  - PH: good buddies at Stellwagen Banks. Leila Hatch from NOAA. Mike Thompson GIS guy. Dave Wiley chief scientist. The classic study as a "success" story. Very simple. More dynamic improvements. [R whale listening network] Seasonal variations.
  - JC: new CetMap sound propogation models for that region, broken up by ship size based on AIS, so AIS helps for that.
- JR:
  - w/in next mo, CetMap paper done & submitted, so maybe density surfaces usable.
  - discourage connecting this w/ critical path of projects
  - Bryde's whales in GoMex up for listing in ESA. patchy distribution & lots of conflicts. Comparative study: rich data R whale, Bryde's whale in GoMex poor data.
- AB:
  - range mapping?
  - PH: PhD student in France just published historic range of r whales, using historic whaling records of Pacific r whales, predicted Atlantic from those.

- PH: stay close to decision making process. risk & loss analysis. more formalized w/ case study.
  - case studies? industry.

- JC: diff't tradeoffs. shipping.
  - ship strike vs noise intxn (ocean sound). diff't outcomes.
  - do case studies
  - want model
  - -> SB Channel: routing

- case area: Arctic. Megan Ferguson working on models. lots of survey data, not yet modeled. variation w/ ice age. Other bowhead whale model guy (Dan).
  - offshore Gulf of Alaska
  -

- talk to Crow White
  - 11am - noon.

- siting in US E coast
  - sand & gravel mining.
  - conflicts w/ turtles
  - fishing entanglement in NE
  - military offshore
  - offshore wind: already defined lease blocks
  - sound oil & gas survey data. lease blocks to oil & gas? state by state by
